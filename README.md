- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @takumimet
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, bioinformatics and scripting. Big noob.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PostgreSQL, R and improving my BASH and PWSH scripting abilities, as well as my Python.

takumimet/takumimet is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository to me, because most of the things I've learned
I've done on my own, which yes lends itself to more errors, but is also very rewarding when
I can see the progress I've made by reading books and watching whatever information is available
on the internet. Of course, criticism is necesarry for one's betterment.
